Let, me, hold, you tight, if only, for one night
Let me keep you near, to ease away, your fear
It would be so nice, if only, for one night

I won't tell a soul, no one has to know
If you want to be, totally discreet
I'll be at, your side, if only for one night
Aye, aye, aye, hey, If only for one night

Your eyes say things, I never hear from you
And my knees are shakin' too
But I'm willin', willin', to go through it
I must be crazy, standin in this place
But I'm feelin' no disgrace, for askin'

Let me hold you tight, if only for one night
Let me keep you near, to ease, away your fears
It would be so nice, if only for one night
Aye, aye, aye, yay, if only for one night

I tell you what I need is
(One night, one night)
Oh, whoa, what I need is you
(One night, one night)
Of your love, of your love
Of your love babe

I'm askin', let me take you home
To keep you safe, and warm
Til' the early dawn, warms up to the sun
It would be so nice, if only for one night

Aye, aye, one night, if only for one night
Oh, ooh, aye yay, yeah hey
If only for one, ooh, oh
Oh, aye, yeah, hey, if only for one night
Ooh ooh, oh,hey, yeah, hey
If only for one night, night, night
Yeah, one night
If only for one, night
