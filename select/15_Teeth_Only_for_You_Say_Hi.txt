An ogre tears out bones
Like yeah, I dreamt he would do to the whales
She likes how the Ramones
Aren't afraid of Eddie Van Halen

The night is falling
I breath in

Teeth only for you
Teeth only for you

Summer starts off cold
Before let's grow up shaggy teenagers
Your eyes, they always glow
Oh, the same blue eyes, your quivering hands

The night is falling
I breath in

Teeth only for you
Teeth only for you

And I will take you out until the sun is finally dry
And we're just beings floating in space
Without a thing but memories
