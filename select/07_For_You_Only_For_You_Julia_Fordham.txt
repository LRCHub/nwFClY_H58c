I cried the Solent, the Tyne, the Severn and the Rhine
The Thames and the Seine over again
But

I won't be crying anymore, a lake of tears like I shed
Before
For you, only for you

The Ganges, the Clyde, the Amazon, the Nile
The Avon, the Trent, the tears that I spent!
But

I won't be crying anymore, all these tears like I she'd
Before
For you, only for you

A sea of love runs deep in these veins
Flooding my heart with anger and pain
The depth of reason, a wave of regret
But the times that we had I'll never forget

But I won't be crying anymore, all these tears
Like I she'd before, for you, only for you,
Only for you, only for you, only...
