It's been a while since I felt this way about someone
I'd really really like to know you more, know you more
Oh your eyes they sing a song to me
And I'd really really like to move to it, groove
And I will open my heart
And I will only for you
Oh your eyes they're spinning 'round my head
And oh, oh this light is on, ooh yeah, on, ooh yeah
Oh your eyes they're spinning 'round my head
And oh, oh this light is on, ooh yeah, on, ooh
And I will open my heart
And I will only for you
And I just don't know what to do
My head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired of trying
And I just don't know what to do
My head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired of trying
Oh your eyes they're spinning 'round my head
And oh, oh this light is on, ooh yeah, on, ooh yeah
Oh your eyes they're spinning 'round my head
And oh, oh this light is on, ooh yeah, on, ooh
And I will open my heart
And I will only for you
