You try to live up to what others believe
'Til you conquer all your fears and just find what you need
In the time that it takes to settle for less
You could have done with what you thought would be best

You set your ideals with the truth that you see
Nothing turns out quite the same as you thought it would be
Counting the times that you've said what you mean
All the reasons to forget what you want to believe

And you know what I'm thinking now
If only for the moment
And you know what I'm thinking now
If only for the moment

(O-only, moment, here)
(O-only, moment, here)
(O-only, moment, here)
(O-only, moment, here)
(Only here)

You set your ideals with the truth that you see
Nothing turns out quite the same as you thought it would be
Counting the times that you've said what you mean
All the reasons to forget what you want to believe

All the reasons to forget what you want to believe
All the reasons to forget what you want to believe
All the reasons to forget what you want to believe
All the reasons to forget what you want to believe
