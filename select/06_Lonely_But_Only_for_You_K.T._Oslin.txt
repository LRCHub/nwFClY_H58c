My friends set me up with someone
They know I'll just love, they say
Oh, he's just your type, he's just the right one
To chase your blues away
Friends are such good arrangers
But I'm not in the mood for strangers

Honey, I'm lonely but only for you
I'm only lonely for all the things we used to do
Hey, I can function quite well, hey, you can hardly tell
That I'm lonely but only for you
Yes, I'm lonely but only for you

Now I miss the love the touch
That melted night into dawn
Oh, I miss the talks, I miss that shoulder
I know I could lean on, it's the same old story
No one else does anything for me

Honey, I'm lonely but only for you
I'm only lonely for all the things we used to do
Hey, I can function quite well, hey, you can hardly tell
That I'm lonely but only for you
Yes, I'm lonely but only for you
I'm so lonely but only for you
