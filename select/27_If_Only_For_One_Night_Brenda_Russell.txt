Let me hold you tight
If only for one night
Let me keep you near
To ease away your fears
It would be so nice
If only for one night

I won't tell a song
No one has to know
If you want to be totally discrete
I'll be at your side
If only for one night
Yeah
If only for one night

Your eyes say things I never hear from you
And my knees are shaking too
But I'm willing, willing to go through
I must be crazy standing in this place
While I'm feeling all disgrace for asking

Let me hold you tight
If only for one night
Let me keep you near
To ease away your fears
It would be so nice
If only for one night
Yeah
If only for one night

(Doo doo doo doo)
Ohhh
(Doo doo doo doo)
Doo doo doo doooo

Let me take you home
To keep you safe and warm
Till the early dawn
Closer to the sun
It would be so nice
If only for one night
Yeah
If only for one night

Ohhhhh
Doo doo doo
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know 'bout tomorrow
I just wanna feel you today
I don't wanna know whoa whoa
I just wanna feel you today
Yeah yeah
Ohhhh
I don't wanna know
Oh no
I say, I just wanna feel you today
